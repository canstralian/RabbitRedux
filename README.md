## 📚 WhiteRabbitNeo Code Classification Model

### Model Overview

The **WhiteRabbitNeo Code Classification Model** is designed to perform text classification tasks, specifically tailored to code functions at various levels of complexity and cybersecurity contexts. This model builds upon the `replit/replit-code-v1_5-3b` base model and leverages advanced machine learning techniques to enhance its performance.

### 📜 License

This model is licensed under the **Apache 2.0 License**.

### 📊 Datasets

The model has been trained on the following datasets:

- **WhiteRabbitNeo/WRN-Chapter-1**: Initial dataset containing a variety of code functions and examples.
- **WhiteRabbitNeo/WRN-Chapter-2**: Expanded dataset with more advanced and varied code functions.
- **WhiteRabbitNeo/Code-Functions-Level-General**: General-purpose code functions covering a broad spectrum of programming concepts.
- **WhiteRabbitNeo/Code-Functions-Level-Cyber**: Specialized dataset focusing on code functions relevant to cybersecurity.
- **replit/agent-challenge**: A challenge dataset from Replit aimed at testing the model's ability to handle complex code scenarios.

### 🗣️ Languages

The model is designed to work with code written in **English (en)**.
