## Model Details

### Model Description
This model card provides an overview of the WhiteRabbitNeo Code Classification Model and its contributions.
- **Developed by:** Stephen de Jager (canstralian)
- **Funded by:** Self-funded
- **Shared by:** Community contributions
- **Model type:** Text classification (code)
- **Language(s):** English
- **License:** Apache 2.0 License
- **Finetuned from model:** replit/replit-code-v1_5-3b

### Model Sources
- **Repository:** [WhiteRabbitNeo](https://github.com/canstralian/WhiteRabbitNeo)
- **Paper:** [WhiteRabbitNeo Research Paper](#)
- **Demo:** [WhiteRabbitNeo Demo](#)

### Uses
#### Direct Use
The model is intended for code classification tasks without fine-tuning.

#### Downstream Use
The model can be fine-tuned for specific tasks or integrated into larger cybersecurity applications.

#### Out-of-Scope Use
Not designed for malicious activities or critical code quality contexts without proper review.

### Bias, Risks, and Limitations
#### Recommendations
Users should be aware of the risks, biases, and limitations of the model to make informed decisions.

## Getting Started with the Model

```python
# Sample code to load and use the model
from transformers import pipeline

# Load the model
classifier = pipeline("text-classification", model="canstralian/WhiteRabbitNeo")

# Example input
code_snippet = "def hello_world():\n    print('Hello, world!')"
result = classifier(code_snippet)
print(result)
```
